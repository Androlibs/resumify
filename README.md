# Resumify!
Simple, beautiful resumes right in your browser!
Resumify is a single page application powered by [vue](https://vuejs.org) to create [resumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) using pre-designed templates right in the client's browser.

The project was inspired by a similar application [vue-resume](https://github.com/luosijie/vue-resume)

#### Build setup
``` bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/riyaz-ali/resumify.git && cd resumify

#### More templates!
Resumify can easily be extended to support more than one template all on the same client-side application by using vue-router, thus, allowing for more beautiful and easy to use stubs for the user.

PRs adding templates as well as features are welcomed!
